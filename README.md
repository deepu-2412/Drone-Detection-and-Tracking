## <u>Dataset Description</u>
<p>
A structured UAV detection dataset containing labeled aerial imagery prepared for training YOLO-based object detection and tracking pipelines.
<br><br>
This UAV Detection Dataset is organized into two main directories:
</p>

- **Images** – Contains all image data, separated into train, validation, and test subsets.  
- **Labels** – Contains YOLO-format annotation files (`.txt`) for train and validation images.
<p>
The dataset contains aerial images with objects belonging to <strong>6 UAV categories</strong>:
</p>

1. f450  
2. helicopter  
3. hushan  
4. multi  
5. plane  
6. phantom  

<p>
These classes cover a wide range of drone types, making the dataset suitable for training YOLO-based drone detection and tracking models.
